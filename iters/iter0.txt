0. About this course: If your work tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, involve the use of Office programs, and/or complicated, then this course will most likely be very beneficial for you. Scripting is a powerful skill that can massively improve work performance:
		(a) A task that has been automated frees up the person/people previously assigned to the task to work on other tasks.
		(b) A computer will complete the task more accurately (and faster) than the people previously assigned to the task, assuming the script is written correctly and well.
	Here is a real example from my personal experience where I found scripting to be a highly appropriate solution: During the last week of each month, my team would have to download an average of ~360 spreadsheets of wirecenter data, each usually containing at least 100,000 rows. We had to format each spreadsheet to follow our template (add 5 columns & their headers, apply conditional formatting to a column, color the left and right halves of the table, etc.), rename the file to follow our naming convention, create a folder using the wirecenter's CLLI, and then move the spreadsheet into the folder. This task was split up between the 9 of us to complete throughout the week and consuming between 3-6 work hours for each person (27 hrs/month at best, 54 hrs/month at worst). The script I wrote to perform this task only required us to download the wirecenter Excel files, and from there it only took 2-4 hours to complete the rest of the task.
