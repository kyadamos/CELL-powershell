I. Setup

	A. Download & Installation
	- get from Teams group files
		- need admin privileges to install via MSI, request here: http://intranet.att.com/elrws/index.php
    - get Visual Studio Code from Team group files
	- if you are not using a Windows machine (Linux or macOS), then you must go to https://software.it.att.com/ and submit a request to download the package of PowerShell 7.4.2 that is compatible with your machine.

		- For macOS users: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.4
			*Note: PowerShell 7 and newer versions require macOS 11 and higher. If you are using at least macOS version 10.12, then you may download and install PowerShell 6.x.

	B. Environment

	- PowerShell refers to both Windows' command-line shell program and the scripting language
		- Command-line shell: A shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and computer.
			- For example, we can use a shell to:
				- Manipulate files and directories (directories = folders) create, delete, copy, move, edit, etc.*
				- Start and stop processes and programs
				- Manage our system's environment variables
				- A combination of these and more to automate tasks
            - Usually, people interact with a command-line by passing commands one after another -- sometimes called "one-liners".
			- Windows computers come with two default shell programs:
				- Command Prompt: Older, basic/bare bones
					- Can open by pressing Windows key and entering "cmd"
				- PowerShell: Powerful, feature-rich, extensible
					- Can open a PowerShell terminal by pressing the Windows key and entering "Windows PowerShell"
		- Scripting language: A scripting language is a class of programming languages; they are typically used to modify and/or automate tasks on a computer system.
			- PowerShell scripts are essentially a set of commands written in a text file and saved with a ".ps1" extension.

	- To write and run our PowerShell scripts, we have a handful of programs to choose from. At the bare minimum, we would need a text editor (e.g. Notepad, Notepad++, WordPad, etc.) to write and edit our scripts, and we would also need PowerShell to run our scripts or execute our one-liners. However, it's not 1990 anymore, so we have access to more sophisticated programs that will make it easier for us to develop our scripts.
    - In this course, we will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in this course and recommend that you do, too, as it has many features to facilitate our development experience. However, if you intend to use a different program for whatever reason, that is fine too.
    - Let us begin by familiarizing ourselves with VS Code. VS Code's interface is split up into a few different panels, each with a specific purpose. We can use the Activity Bar, located along the left-hand side, to switch between some of these panels.
        - Editor:
            The Editor is the main area of VS Code that displays and lets us edit the contents of whatever file(s) that we have open. If there are multiple files open, then we can switch between them using their tabs at the top; if we would like to view two or more files at the same time, then we can even split the Editor by clicking on View > Editor Layout > Split ___.

        - Explorer: (Ctrl + Shift + E)
            The Explorer can be displayed on the left by clicking on its icon in the Activity Bar, and it serves as VS Code's integrated File Explorer. The Explorer panel gives us a structured, top-level view of the files and folders that we open in VS Code, and it also allows us to create, delete, rename, and move files and folders around.

        - Panel/Terminal:
            We can open the Panel by clicking on View > Appearance > Panel; it contains a few useful secondary tools and displays, but for this course we'll most likely only need the Terminal tab. The Terminal tab allows us to open a variety of different terminals (PowerShell, bash, Command Prompt/CMD) integrated right inside VS Code.

        - Extensions:
            We can also open the Extensions panel from the Activity Bar, and it will appear on the left. VS Code offers a LOT of user-submitted extensions to further extend the capabilities of VS Code -- please be sure to install the PowerShell extension, as it will make our learning & development experience so much easier.
